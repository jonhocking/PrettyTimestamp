PrettyTimestamp
===============

An NSDate Category that returns human readable, pretty timestamps between two dates. 

Currently only available in English and Dutch, easily localizable to other languages.




Examples
========

All returned strings are in lower case and plural / singular handled

"just now"

"1 minute ago"

"3 months ago"

"over a year ago"




Usage
======

Automatically orders dates for you so no need to worry about which is earliest. Just call one of the three category methods and you're done :).



Questions
===================
